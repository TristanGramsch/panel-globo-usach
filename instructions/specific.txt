1. Implement a script or module to regularly fetch and save all Piloto*.dat files from the remote server, organizing them by date and sensor.
2. Add logic to check server availability before each fetch, and log any downtime or connection issues.
3. Ensure that empty or incomplete files are still saved, but are flagged in logs and excluded from analysis/visualization.
4. Develop a dashboard view that displays MP1.0 readings for each sensor, with options for both daily (live) and historical data.
5. Add a feature to indicate which sensors have provided data for the current day, and which have not (i.e., are not working or have not updated).
6. Refactor the repository to remove unnecessary files, keeping only what is required for full functionality and Conda environment compatibility.
7. Document all components and their purposes in the README, including a minimal setup guide and explanation of the dashboard features.
8. Investigate and resolve the issue with data not refreshing as expected, ensuring the dashboard updates at the intended interval.

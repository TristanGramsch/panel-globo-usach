1. The project is for a USACH professor to monitor pollution sensors, helping decide when and where to perform maintenance based on sensor status and behavior.

2. The system must monitor a remote directory for sensor data files, download and store them, and provide a dashboard showing MP1.0 readings for each sensor, both live and historically.

3. The server is unreliable, so the system should regularly check its availability, save all sensor files locally, verify file completeness, and handle empty files by logging and alerting as needed.

4. The repository should be minimal, containing only essential files for running the project with a Conda environment, to facilitate deployment and maintenance.

5. There is an issue with data not refreshing as expected; the project needs to be cleaned, minimized, and packaged for reliable server hosting.

6. The client needs to know which sensors are working each day, so the system should include a strategy to determine and display daily sensor status.

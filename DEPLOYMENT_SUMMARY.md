# USACH Air Quality Monitor - Deployment Summary

## Project Overview
Successfully created and deployed a comprehensive air quality monitoring dashboard for Universidad de Santiago de Chile (USACH) using **Dash/Plotly framework** with a **three-tab interface** that preserves existing functionality while adding new sensor health monitoring capabilities.

## Key Features Implemented
- **Three-Tab Dashboard Interface**: General Overview, Sensor Specific Analysis, and Sensor Health Monitoring
- **Real-time Data Visualization**: Interactive charts showing MP1.0 trends with WHO guidelines
- **Automatic Data Fetching**: Continuous background fetching from remote server every 10 minutes
- **Multi-location Monitoring**: Support for multiple monitoring stations across USACH campus
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Time-series visualization with customizable sensor selection
- **Sensor Health Overview**: Comprehensive maintenance planning with data quality assessment
- **Responsive Design**: Modern, mobile-friendly interface with clean tabbed navigation

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11+ with Dash/Plotly framework
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation and analysis
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts and graphs
- **Data Fetching**: Custom PilotoFileFetcher with retry logic and health monitoring
- **Deployment**: Standalone server on port 8050 with background data collection

## Dashboard Tab Structure

### Tab 1: General Overview
- **Status Cards**: Average MP1.0, maximum readings, sensor operational count, last update
- **Multi-Sensor Chart**: Real-time trends for all sensors with WHO reference lines
- **Daily Status Summary**: Working vs non-working sensors breakdown

### Tab 2: Sensor Specific Analysis  
- **Sensor Selection**: Dropdown to choose any available sensor
- **Individual Charts**: Detailed time-series with markers for selected sensor
- **Detailed Statistics**: Data range, point count, min/max/average values

### Tab 3: Sensor Health & Maintenance
- **Health Overview Table**: Comprehensive status for all sensors
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor based on daily data points
- **Maintenance Indicators**: Last reading timestamps, working status, data point counts

## Deployment Status
✅ **SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED**
- Application running on http://localhost:8050
- Process ID: 3253533 (confirmed active)
- All dependencies installed and configured
- Data pipeline operational with automatic fetching
- Three-tab interface accessible and responsive
- Background data fetching working (10-minute intervals)

## New Features Added (Meeting Requirements)
1. ✅ **Automatic Piloto*.dat file fetching** with smart update detection
2. ✅ **Server availability checks** before each fetch with logging
3. ✅ **Empty/incomplete file handling** with proper error flagging
4. ✅ **MP1.0 readings dashboard** with daily and historical views
5. ✅ **Sensor working status indicators** showing which sensors provided data today
6. ✅ **Clean repository structure** with minimal necessary files
7. ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** in README with setup guide
8. ✅ **Dashboard refresh functionality** working at 10-minute intervals

## Usage Instructions
1. **Start Application**: `python main.py` or `./start.sh`
2. **Access Dashboard**: Open http://localhost:8050 in web browser
3. **Navigate Tabs**: 
   - **General Overview**: Monitor overall air quality status
   - **Sensor Specific**: Analyze individual sensor performance  
   - **Sensor Health**: Plan maintenance and identify issues
4. **Export Data**: Data available via processing functions
5. **Stop Application**: Ctrl+C or kill process

## Technical Improvements Made
- **Fixed Dashboard Errors**: Resolved `'int' object is not subscriptable` error
- **Improved Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks throughout
- **Enhanced Data Processing**: Better datetime handling and validation
- **Robust Fetching**: Automatic retry logic with server health checks
- **Better Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging and monitoring

## Environment Setup
- Python virtual environment: `piloto_env`
- All dependencies installed via pip and conda
- Configuration files properly set up
- Data directories created and configured
- Background processes running correctly

## Performance Metrics
- **Data Fetching**: Successfully fetching from 11 sensors (013, 019, 023, 048, 052, 057, 078, 081, 098, 100, 102)
- **Update Frequency**: 10-minute background data refresh
- **Server Response**: Handling unreliable server with retry logic
- **Dashboard Performance**: Fast tab switching and chart rendering

## Next Steps for Production
- Configure reverse proxy for production deployment (nginx)
- Set up SSL/TLS certificates for secure access
- Implement user authentication if needed
- Add email/SMS alert notifications for sensor failures
- Scale for additional sensors as network expands
- Set up automated backups of sensor data

## Monitoring & Maintenance
- **Logs**: Check `logs/main_application.log` for application status
- **Data Health**: Use Sensor Health tab to identify problematic sensors
- **Server Status**: Background fetching handles server outages automatically
- **Performance**: Monitor memory usage for long-running deployment

## Support
